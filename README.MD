## What?

This is a first 85 000 NFT's objects json dump from hicetnunc.xyz **with only mime types**:

* model/gltf+json
* model/gltf-binary

However, this repository consists analyzer summary report for all existed objects (without copyminted or banned):

### summary-full.json

This file describes mimeType <-> objectId relation.

### summary.json

```
// There is no 85 000 objects because some kind of they just banned.

  }
}

```

## Why?

The interactive 3d models and javascript art objects are the most valuable to me as NFT tokens. But a lot of objects at hicetnunc.xyz gallery are 
the images, gif and videos. I just filtered out the objects with other mime types.


## What's next?

Actually this is a preparation for '100 000 minted objects' day! And it will be the first 100k interactive objects dump in the future.

It also may be realtime updated repository as well. Will see.
