This project exploits the fact that floating point numeric systems cannot  represent all real numbers. This can be seen in most digital 3d systems when  geometry is modelled or moved very far away from the origin of the 3d scene.  This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem.  A sphere and a 440Hz sine wave were chosen because of their continuity. Both of these objects were subjected to the same manipulation in 3d space. As they move farther from their origin, they can no longer be represented as continuous elements. The digital systems designed to represent them break down. Â© 2021 Luis E.
