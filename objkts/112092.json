THIS NFT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND ON HICETNUNC. IT IS RENDERED LIVE, CONSTRUCTED FROM A STRING OF 49,192 HEXADECIMAL DIGITS STORED DIRECTLY ON THE TEZOS BLOCKCHAIN. IT IS ALSO FULLY UPGRADEABLE, AS THE ADMIN (MYSELF) CAN DEPLOY UPDATES WHICH WILL INSTANTLY APPEAR ON THIS NFT. 10,000 EDITIONS HAVE BEEN MINTED TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY FOR ALL. EVERY UNSOLD EDITION WILL BE BURNED ON 2021-06-30. Collecting multiple copies is fine, if you wish to do so. All sales will fund further development of this specific project. The deployment cost of the data for this NFT was approximately 7 XTZ. Future releases will be open-source and include tutorial documentation to help others learn how to use and deploy your own versions of my code. What you see here is just the beginning; I have many other features planned for this application but there will only be one \"first\"! Thank you for your attention.","tags":["mathmakesart","math","profile","python","p5js","jquery","square","image","live","render","link","connect","connection","experimental","experiment","tezos","xtz","one","chain","onchain","on-chain","storage","stored","128","49192"],"symbol":"OBJKT","artifactUri":"ipfs://QmZQ8x57scdDG9jMA4mLPHyZT6yYQXSkz9pn2YVH3BX7Af","displayUri":"ipfs://QmX4yince4Ax1GZ5W6xwcAaUDFvnBqt8xEcVohZZtM8gvA","thumbnailUri":"ipfs://Qma7mY9YTXsdfqFTPnr2DgQRmU2rmrkie4eHPBeqfkRHFD","creators":["tz1gsrd3CfZv4BfPnYKq5pKpHGFVdtGCgd71"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZQ8x57scdDG9jMA4mLPHyZT6yYQXSkz9pn2YVH3BX7Af","mimeType":"application/x-directory"}],"decimals":0,"isBooleanAmount":false,"shouldPreferSymbol":false}}
