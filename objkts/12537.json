Generative pixelart of my Tezos address (tz1gsrd3CfZv4BfPnYKq5pKpHGFVdtGCgd71). NOTE: This is a test of the new HicEtNunc HTML minting feature, and I do not intend to sell this piece. This piece is an extension of my previous two p5js mints, OBJKT#12489 and OBJKT#12524. In this mint I have modified the stylesheet to hopefully center-align the canvas. The script itself is functionally identical to OBJKT#12524.","tags":["mathmakesart","math","p5js","processing","javascript","generative","animation","animated","html","tezos","address","base64"],"symbol":"OBJKT","artifactUri":"ipfs://Qmd3MS76vN7RA5mCtHm6XR8WJ44ni7YscBjC8sm9tddoGc","displayUri":"ipfs://QmXXabu4kaCDro1hNmyFf8mV4ZJHaq5sfrXmDe3Xuyq8N8","creators":["tz1gsrd3CfZv4BfPnYKq5pKpHGFVdtGCgd71"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://Qmd3MS76vN7RA5mCtHm6XR8WJ44ni7YscBjC8sm9tddoGc","mimeType":"application/x-directory"}],"thumbnailUri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","decimals":0,"isBooleanAmount":false,"shouldPreferSymbol":false}}
