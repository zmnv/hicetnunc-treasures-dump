The combination is made up of 10 element types, each with up to 10 + 1 red variants. The works of The Unknown Portraits Series are digital drawings or paintings in which the artist addresses the \"portraitsâ€œ in the digital age - it's about avatars and profile pictures, face recognition and the handling of personal rights in today's world.
