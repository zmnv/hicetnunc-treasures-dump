Our film “Pirenopolynda” which started recording on the 5th and will run until the 12th of June in the city of Pirenópolis-Goias is in need of your help to maintain the protocols against covid 19. With a very tight budget, the film was supposed to have been shot in 2019 and since then the prices of things have changed. We had to adapt a lot to this pandemic period, change the script, reduce staff and there are many protocols against covid that we cannot give up. We are having to assume a production structure that had not been thought of, such as e.g. ensuring that the team is isolated in Piri, covid tests, ... all this has generated a very high expense that we are not able to afford. Our direct expenses with this are around R$6,000 (around U$1,184) and that for our film's budget is a hole. That's why we came here to ask whoever can contribute any amount! pix with the key: Filmepirenopolynda@gmail.com paypal: frfolle@gmail.com !
