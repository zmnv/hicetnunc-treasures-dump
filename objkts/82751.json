Window to the Soul allows you to step into the Window and interact with the environment just by walking by. The two tracks stored on John's computer were created by me for the NFT, and while their start is similar, both songs capture different feelings. Controls: WASD to move, you can interact with the cat, water cooler and change the song at the computer just by approaching the objects.
