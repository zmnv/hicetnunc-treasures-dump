This art piece is referring to trypillian culture (c. 5500 to 2750 BCE). I found an inspiration by looking at the stone part of an ancient axe in the Museum of Local Lore. The stone itself was very beautiful and was used for trading and barter as an early form of money (barter token). Money from the initial sale of this NFT will go to NGO “Laboratory of Culture”.
