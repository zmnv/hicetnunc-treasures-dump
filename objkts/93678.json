Using 3D Scanning as an artistic medium, Menegon’s self-scanning procedure, combined with the use of low-budget technology, challenges the notion of the virtual as perfect and exposes the results of the scans “as is”, with all the beautiful flaws, mistakes and data loss. Untouched, those failures present a new authentic digital body, an avatar fixed in time yet always performing.","tags":["3D","Digital","Virtual","AR","AugmentedReality","DigitalArt","InteractiveArt","VirtualSculpture","PerformativeVirtualSculpture","VirtualBody","Avatar","DigitalBody","VirtualSelf","DigitalSelf","VirtualSelfie","Selfie","3DScan","MartinaMenegon"],"symbol":"OBJKT","artifactUri":"ipfs://QmRruUHV3FX4y5RD5Lgpneg6JTK6CCtkV1rkLLWmBDGaaX","displayUri":"ipfs://QmPpjArnSZVfN22yDaf2NRL71zRMk4yDz3oB5R13UGdgAS","thumbnailUri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1hHrLjpRrRh881NdYaH7FAFy6wdPuLc6iU"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmRruUHV3FX4y5RD5Lgpneg6JTK6CCtkV1rkLLWmBDGaaX","mimeType":"application/x-directory"}],"decimals":0,"isBooleanAmount":false,"shouldPreferSymbol":false}}
